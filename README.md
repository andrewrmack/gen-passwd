# gen-passwd
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andrewrmack/gen-passwd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andrewrmack/gen-passwd)
Generates a random password using /dev/urandom. Just a small project
that I though I would upload incase it's useful to anyone else. It takes
flags that specify the length of the password to be generated and the set
of valid characters for the password. No config, just `make` and run.
